<h1>Sounds And Music</h1>

<h2>This section explains how to add a sound resource to your game.</h2>

<p>
To add a sound resource to your game, use the <a href="Drop%20Down%20Menus/The%20Resources%20Menu.html">Resource</a> menu or right-click on the resource tree and select <b>Create Sound</b>, or you  can use 
the corresponding button on the toolbar. Any of those will bring up the following window :

<img class="center"  src="../Images/form_sound.png">

To load a sound, press the <b>Load Sound</b> button to the right of the sound name. A file selector dialogue pops up in which you can select the sound file, which can <i>only</i> be either a wave file or an mp3 file. 
In general, Wave files (<tt>*.wav</tt>) are used for the short sound effects as even though they are generally larger files they will play instantaneously due to the fact that they do not need any type of decoding for 
playing. You can also have multiple wave files playing at once, which is why you should use these for all the sound effects in your game.
<br>
<br>

Mp3 (<tt>*.mp3</tt>) files should be used for background music as </i>GameMaker:Studio</i> only permits you to play <b>one</b> music track at a time. These files are much smaller than a wave file would be 
but have a small CPU overhead as they have to be decoded before being played, hence the limit of only one mp3 file being played at time (however, you can have multiple music tracks in your game, and you would 
just switch between them when necessary).
<br>

Once you have loaded your file you can preview the sound by using the play button which will loop it continuously. This is very handy as it means you can make changes to the volume using the slider at the bottom 
of the window and hear what the effect it will have on the sound. There is a stop button too, so you can stop the preview at any time. 
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
<i><b>NOTE: </b>If you are using the <b>Free</b> version of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> you are limited to a maximum of 10 sounds per game. For more details see 
<a href="../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">here</a>.</i>
<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE: </b>Previous versions of <i>GameMaker</i> accepted midi file format but that is not the case with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. You cannot use midi any longer and any imported files from 
legacy versions which use these may cause the program to crash. These files should be removed or changed before testing!</i>
<br>
<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
The sound window also has other options which are explained below.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Compression</h3>
<p>
The above rules for file types are for the default configuration of <b>Uncompressed</b> audio. However, you can select to <b>Compressed</b> audio should you wish to use that. What this will do is force all your 
sound files (irrespective of whether they are <tt>*.wav</tt> or <tt>*.mp3</tt>) to be compressed down to <i>Ogg Vorbis</i> <tt>*.ogg</tt> format files for all platforms.
<br>
<br>

These sounds are smaller on disc, but will have a slight CPU overhead due to the need to be uncompressed before being played, so you should keep that in mind if you wish to use compression in an already CPU 
intensive game.
<br>
<br>

It is also worth noting that using compressed audio will permit you to use the <a href="../002_Reference/Game%20Assets/Sounds/index.html"><tt>audio_sound_*</tt></a> functions for both music <i>and</i> 
sound effects, permitting you to "layer" music or change it's pitch etc... With uncompressed audio you must use the <tt>audio_music*</tt> functions to play <tt>*.mp3</tt> files, and will only be able to have 
one music track playing at a time.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Streaming</h3>
<p>
If you have chosen <b>compressed</b> audio, you can then also choose to have your sound as <b>streamed</b> or <b>not streamed</b>. A streamed sound will be one that is uncompressed and played in 
real time, streamed form the disc.

Streaming is ideal for music as it reduces the one off overhead of uncompressing the whole file, which may cause a pause in the game, but is not recommended for simple sound effects where the hit on the 
CPU is much less.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Target Options</h3>
<p>
The <b>Target Options</b> panel is where you set the conversion rates for your game. These settings will affect how the sound is exported for the target platform, 
and <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will automatically convert your sound files for you - you simply control the final quality of those sounds when converted. Generally 
the default settings of 16 bit, 44100kHz and 192kbps are perfectly adequate, but it may be that you wish sound effects (for example) to have a lower quality and 
music to have a higher quality, in which case these settings can be changed.
<br>
<br>

You can also choose whether the conversion should be mono, stereo or 3D. If you plan on using the audio emitter functions to create 3D sound effects, you should 
indicate this here, otherwise choose mono or stereo depending on the use that the sounds are going to be put to.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>The higher the quality, the larger the file, and this should be taken into account when deciding what bitrate to choose.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3>External Editor</h3>
<p>
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> does not have a built-in sound editor. But, in the <a href="../001_Advanced%20Use/Preferences/Editor%20Preferences.html">Editor Preferences</a>, you can indicate external 
editors that you want to use for editing sounds. If you selected these you can press the button labeled <b>Edit Sound</b> to open the chosen editor and change the current sound. The <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> 
window will be hidden while you edit the sound and returns when you close the sound editor (you must save the sound in the editor first otherwise it will not be saved in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>).
