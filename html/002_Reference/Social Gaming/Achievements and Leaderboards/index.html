<h1>Achievements and Leaderboards</h1>

<h2>Here you can find the functions for integrating your game with the available leaderboard and achievements APIs</h2>

<p>
Games that are made to target devices that run iOS or Android can also connect to one of two leaderboard and achievement API's. For iOS you have the <b>iTunes Game Center</b>, and for Android you 
can use the <b>Amazon Game Circle</b> or <b>Google Play</b>, with all of them using the using the functions found on this page. These functions permit your game to send information on scores and 
achievements to the leaderboards that you have set up in the Developers Account for the game you are making and is an excellent way to get players involved in the social side of gaming as they can then 
see what other people who have played your game have achieved and try to better them.
<br>
<br>

When using these functions, you should note that they do <i>not</i> track achievements and scores automatically for you. They only show the data that you send them from your game, so you must code your 
own achievements and hi-score system to keep track of the individuals status in game, then use these functions to add the data to the chosen network (however you <i>can</i> request progress information for 
achievements using the <a href="achievement_load_progress.html"><tt>achievement_load_progress</tt></a> function).
<br>
<br>

Some of these functions will trigger a callback <a href="../../../001_Advanced Use/More About Async Events/Social.html">Social Asynchronous Event</a>, which will contain a <tt>ds_map</tt> of data relating 
to the function that triggered it. Those functions that trigger the event also detail the map key/value pairs that are returned by the callback, however a callback <b>Social Event</b> can also be triggered by your 
game receiving external notifications about challenges etc... The exact details of the <tt>ds_map</tt> returned for these events are explained in the <a href="../../../001_Advanced Use/More About Async Events/Social.html">
Social Asynchronous Event</a> section.
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
<i><b>NOTE: </b>For these functions to work with iOS you must have a valid Game Center account and an iOS <b>app id</b> for your game.</i>
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>For these functions to work with Android you must submit your game to the Amazon App store, or to Google Play, and have set up the necessary sections as well as have the API activated in the 
<a href="../../../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/Android%20Tab.html.">Global Game Settings</a> for your game.</i>
<br>
<br> 
</blockquote>

<h3>Local High Scores</h3>
<p>
Apart from these functions for devices, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> also integrates a basic highscore storage system that is local to your game and compatible with all platforms. This system can store 
up to ten places (with names and scores) locally, which you can then draw on-screen as you wish. For more information see:
