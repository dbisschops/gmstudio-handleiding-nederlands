<h1>Immersion Haptics</h1>

<h2>This section deals with haptic effects for Android devices.</h2>

<p>
Haptics are similar to the "rumble packs" on game consoles, brought to mobile devices and the technology uses fine control over the vibration motor on a device 
to accentuate audio-visual effects within the game. This means that as well as seeing and hearing a shot (or collision, or bounce, or engine, etc), the player can also 
<i>feel</i> it. This provides higher level of user engagement, and consequent monetization opportunities.
<br>
<br>

The haptic library in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> is provided by <b>Immersion</b> (of San Jose, California) and is licensed without charge for use in your games. 
However, to use haptic effects, you will need to tick the "<i>Use Haptics</i>" check-box on the 
<a href="../../../001_advanced%20use/global%20game%20settings/android%20tab.html">Android Tab</a> in the <b>Global Game Settings</b>, and accept the 
<i>Immersion EULA</i> (End User License Agreement) that is shown. After you accept the EULA, you will be able to successfully compile your game in 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> with haptic effects enabled.
<br>
<br>

To help developers feel haptic effects in a game context, and also to review the set of over 100 effects, please install the free 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.immersion.android.hapticmuse" target="_blank"> </b>Immersion Haptic Muse app</b></a> onto your Android test 
device. The Haptic Muse app lets you choose individual effects, feel them in game scenarios, and select the effects that work best in your game.
<br>
<br>

It is worth noting that haptic effects are used in over 2,000 game apps from around the world and that the technology consumes less battery power than playing
the sound effects in a game.  Game apps with Haptic technology enhance the satisfaction of game players both casual and hardcore and can differentiate your app 
from many others in the market place.
<br>
<br>

The Immersion integrated API is easy to use, with only two control functions:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="immersion_play_effect.html">immersion_play_effect</a><br>
		<li><a href="immersion_stop.html">immersion_stop</a><br>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
